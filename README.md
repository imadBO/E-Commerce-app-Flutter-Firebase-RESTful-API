# E-Commerce-app-Flutter-Firebase-RESTful-API
A simple E-commerce mobile app, which I used in order to work with and understand how to deal with RESTful APIs. So as firebase provides hosted backend services such as real-time database, ready-made authentication options and many more services, I chose to use it's RESTful API as a backend solution to make the whole healthcare software development process faster while maintaining the solution's safety and performance.
